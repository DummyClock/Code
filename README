How to Run-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Upon executing the file, the user will be greated and prompted to enter their name. 
Once entered, the name will saved and the player will be rewarded with a starter Pokemon
called Squirtle, 5 Pokeballs, and 3 Potions.
	The user will then be presented a menu that will allow to make a selection; simply type in the number
of the option you'd like to do and it will execute. Further prompts may await in the other options.

-----In Wild and Trainer Battles----
	These selections will further prompt the user for battle commands. When a battle starts, the 
player will automatically use one of their Pokemon to battle. From their, they will prompted for action.
The player can either battle the foe, use an item from their bag, change out their current pokemon, or
RUN AWAY! If the player chooses to battle, they will be prompted again to choose a move their Pokemon knows,
afterwards their Pokemon will attack the foe, but in return they will be attacked as well. Some moves the 
Pokemon do will lower the opposing Pokemon's health, but other moves can lower the stats of the opposing Pokemon;
ultimately making the opposing Pokemon have a disadvantage in battle. Both Pokemon continue taking turns until one 
faints. In a wild battle, this will end the match. In a trainer battle, the trainer with fainted Pokemon will only
surrender if they have no other Pokemon in their team that aren't fainted.
